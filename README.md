Maintenance Tracker App is an application that provides users with the ability to reach out to operations or repairs department regarding repair or maintenance requests and monitor the status of their request.
The user makes requests following certain criteria from their home page and those requests are sent to the admin who then has permissions to approve or disapprove a specific request based on any certain reason.
The admin as well flags requests as done or pending depending on whether or not the requests have been attended to or not.
