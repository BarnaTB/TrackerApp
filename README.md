Maintenance Tracker App is an application that provides users with the ability to reach out to operations or repairs department regarding repair or maintenance requests and monitor the status of their request.

# Description
The user makes requests by entering the request type, request category and request details inside the text fields. 
The requests can then be retrieved by the user from the database.


# Future
The application is currrently using persistent data with postgres database but work is underway to intergrate a user interface using ReactJS.
The backend is also still under development to implement more user authentication, that is, an admin and a normal user.
